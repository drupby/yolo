Drupal 8 boilerplate theme build on node.js, gulp and sass.

## Features:
* Autoprefixer
* Sass Sourcemaps
* SC5 Style Guide Generator - just run gulp and visit http://localhost:3000.
* CLUB (Cmponent, Layout, Unexpected, Base)- based od SMACSS but there is the special directory called 'unexpected' for scss files which don't match to base/component/layout, e.g. whole pages.
## TODO:
* BEM
* Integrate drupal breakpoints module with sass (https://www.lullabot.com/articles/sharing-breakpoints-between-drupal-8-and-sass)
* SMACSS vs %placeholder and @extend: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/extending-in-sass-without-mess/
